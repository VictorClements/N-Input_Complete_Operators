# Complete-Operators-Code
ANYONE MAY USE MY CODE FOR THEIR PURPOSES

this is just some code to help me determine how a boolean operator can be incomplete
it's mainly to help me understand the possible outputs that an incomplete boolean operator results in.
Hopefully that can help me with a proof I am attempting for a Math course I am taking.
Should it help you, then feel free to use it.
