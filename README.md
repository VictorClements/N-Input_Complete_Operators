# Complete-Operators-Code

This code is to help me determine what causes a boolean operator to be incomplete
it's mainly to help me understand the possible outputs that an incomplete boolean operator results in.
Hopefully that can help me with a proof I am attempting for a Math course I am taking.
Should it help you, then feel free to use it.
